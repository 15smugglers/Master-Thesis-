# Master-Thesis-
This is the README.md for my Master Thesis. I only uploaed the essential part of the code. For detailed description of changes and origin of the code this thesis is build on, please see the Appendix of the thesis. Most of the results where obtained by setting the year accordingly. 

## PL 
Code for the Plackett-Luce model. Added the case for beta unconstrained and case without beta. Also fixed bugs 

## PO 
Code the the Partial order model. Adjusted the code where necessary to load and run the chimpanzee data

## Foerster et al. 
Adjusted their code to extract the Elo scores to model ranks for Elo model 

## Model Comparision
Code to compute sum of lambda and beta to calculate the rankgs for the Plackett-Luce model. Please note: the Plot.WAIC file not only plots the WAIC values but also calculates them.
